        <h1>Responsible Problem Solving: course components</h1>
        <h2>Focusing on the societal consequences of design choices in data structures and algorithms</h2>
	<p>
A computer science student first learns problem solving in data structures and algorithms. She learns to define a problem
clearly, break it into solvable components, reason about the correctness of any proposed solution, measure
resources used by her solution (space and time) and how to use them efficiently.
<p>
But when computer scientists apply these problem­solving skills to questions and systems that impact society,
responsible problem design and solution requires that we model societal costs and resources accurately.
In these curricular components, we aim to bring questions and issues from impacted societal domains into the 
data structures and algorithms curriculum where computer science students first learn a problem­solving mindset. 
We aim to create computer scientists who naturally consider issues such as sustainability, racism, and community impact (e.g., of
surveillance) alongside matters of data structure design and complexity.
<p>
On this site, we post the slides and assignments for curricular modules that are core components of the standard data structures
and algorithms curriculum reimagined to include a focus on responsibility.

	 <h2>Criminal Justice</h2>
	 <p>
	 This assignment introduces students to the idea of risk assessments in the context of an introductory data structures assignment introducing the idea of classes.

	 <h3>Data Structures (CS 2) Lesson: ProPublica Machine Bias article and Object-oriented programming</h3>
	 <b>Level</b>: This lesson is designed to be one of the first assignments in a standard Java-based CS 2 course.
	 <p>
	 <b>Topics</b>: objects, classes, ArrayList, data structure design, reading in data
	 <p>
	 <b>Background</b>: We suggest that you have students prepare for this assignment by, in order, watching / reading the below:
	 <ol>
	   <li>Watching this <a href="https://youtu.be/17eDz5HA_qI">video about the ProPublica article</a> (~1.5 min) - we recommend showing this in class.
	   <li>Reading the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">ProPublica Machine Bias article</a>
	   <li>Watching this <a href="http://sorelle.friedler.net/riskassessmentsintro.mp4">background video</a> (~5 min) of Haverford student Steve Lee '21 describing risk assessments and the surrounding criminal justice context.
	 </ol>
	 Assignment files coming soon.

	 <h2>Elections</h2>
	 <p>These assignments focus on the U.S. elections process in the context of an introductory data structures course.  One lesson can be found below and the other is the deduplication of 
	 voting rolls assignment that also includes a focus on <a href="#complexity">sustainability and complexity</a>.
	 <div class="jumbotron" style="background-color: #ebe9e1;">
	 <h3> Data Structures (CS 2) Lesson: Polling Data, Binary Trees, and Heaps</h3>
	 <b>Level</b>: This lesson is designed to be part of the introduction to data structures for binary trees and priority queues in a standard Java-based CS 2 course.
	 <p>
	 <b>Topics</b>: recursive binary tree design, array-based heaps
	 <p>
	 Assignment files coming soon.

	<h2>Sustainability and Complexity</h2>
	<p>
	The goal of these lessons and assignments is to introduce students to the environmental impacts of computing.
	 <p>
	 <i>These lessons were created with the help of <a href="https://www.haverford.edu/users/jwilson">Jon Wilson</a> in Haverford College's Environmental Studies Department.</i>

	<h3>Data Structures (CS 2) Lesson: Energy Usage, Complexity, Deduplication, and Voting Rolls</h3>
	<b>Level</b>: This lesson is designed to be part of a standard data structures curriculum where notions of complexity are being introduced for the first time.  The lesson is designed to come late in the course and could even be used as a final project.
	<p>
	<b>Topics</b>: energy usage, complexity, sorting, hash tables, deduplication, voting

	<h3>Analysis of Algorithms Lesson: Energy Usage and Complexity</h3>
	<p>
	<b>Level</b>: This lesson is designed to accompany Chapter 2 of Algorithm Design by Kleinberg and Tardos, and could also generally be used
	as a second lesson on complexity after the initial introduction of the high level and/or formal definitions in a data structures or algorithms
	course.
	<p>
	<b>Background</b>: In order to determine the energyusage and CO2 emissions of a function, the Python 3 package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/energyusage/">energyusage</a> uses methodology outlined in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08354">paper</a>.
