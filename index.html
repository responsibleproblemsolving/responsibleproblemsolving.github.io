        <h1>Responsible Problem Solving: course components</h1>
        <h2>Focusing on the societal consequences of design choices in data structures and algorithms</h2>
	<p>
A computer science student first learns problem solving in data structures and algorithms. She learns to define a problem
clearly, break it into solvable components, reason about the correctness of any proposed solution, measure
resources used by her solution (space and time) and how to use them efficiently.
<p>
But when computer scientists apply these problem­solving skills to questions and systems that impact society,
responsible problem design and solution requires that we model societal costs and resources accurately.
In these curricular components, we aim to bring questions and issues from impacted societal domains into the 
data structures and algorithms curriculum where computer science students first learn a problem­solving mindset. 
We aim to create computer scientists who naturally consider issues such as sustainability, racism, and community impact (e.g., of
surveillance) alongside matters of data structure design and complexity.
<p>
On this site, we will post the slides and assignments for curricular modules that are core components of the standard data structures
and algorithms curriculum reimagined to include a focus on responsibility.
<p>
More soon!

	<h3>Analysis of Algorithms Lesson</h3>
	<p>
	<b>Level</b>: This lesson is designed to accompany Chapter 2 of Algorithm Design by Kleinberg and Tardos, and could also generally be used
	as a second lesson on complexity after the initial introduction of the high level and/or formal definitions in a data structures or algorithms
	course.
	<p>
	<b>Background</b>: In order to determine the energyusage and CO2 emissions of a function, the Python 3 package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/energyusage/">energyusage</a> uses methodology outlined in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08354">paper</a>.
